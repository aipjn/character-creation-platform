# PRD: Character Creation Platform

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered web platform that enables video creators and advertising professionals to generate customizable characters using Google's nanoBanana model. The platform offers a two-step workflow: initial character generation from text descriptions or uploaded photos, followed by advanced styling with various poses, actions, and scene modifications. Features a freemium business model with 3 free daily generations and paid tiers for professional use.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Video creators and advertising professionals need quick, high-quality character generation for their content, but current solutions are either too expensive, too time-consuming, or require specialized artistic skills. Manual character creation can take hours or days, while existing AI tools often lack the specific styling and customization needed for professional video and advertising content.

**Why is this important now?**
- Growing demand for AI-generated content in video and advertising
- Google's nanoBanana model provides state-of-the-art character generation capabilities
- Professional creators need streamlined workflows to meet tight production deadlines
- Cost-effective character generation can democratize high-quality content creation

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**1. Video Content Creator (Primary)**
- Creates YouTube videos, social media content, or online courses
- Needs diverse characters for storytelling or educational content
- Values quick turnaround and consistent character quality
- Budget-conscious but willing to pay for professional results

**2. Advertising Creative (Primary)**  
- Works at agencies or in-house marketing teams
- Needs characters that match specific brand guidelines
- Requires multiple variations of characters for A/B testing
- Has higher budget but strict timeline requirements

**3. Freelance Designer (Secondary)**

- Values batch processing for efficiency
- Seeks competitive pricing for resale to clients

### User Journeys

**Journey 1: Quick Character Generation**
1. User logs into platform
2. Selects "Create New Character" 
3. Provides text description or uploads reference photo
4. Selects character style (cartoon/realistic)
5. Clicks "Generate" and receives 4 character variations
6. Downloads preferred character for immediate use

**Journey 2: Advanced Character Styling**
1. User generates base character (Journey 1)
2. Selects character for further customization
3. Uses styling tools to modify pose, action, or scene
4. Previews changes in real-time
5. Generates final styled character
6. Downloads high-resolution output

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Time-consuming manual character design
- Expensive professional illustration services  
- Inconsistent character quality across projects
- Limited customization in existing AI tools
- Complex workflows that interrupt creative process

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Expectations**
- Character generation response time: < 30 seconds per batch
- Platform availability: 99.5% uptime
- Concurrent user support: 100+ simultaneous generations
- Image quality: High-resolution output (minimum 1024x1024px)
- API rate limiting aligned with Google nanoBanana constraints

**Security Considerations**
- Secure API key management for Google nanoBanana integration
- User data encryption at rest and in transit
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- User authentication via OAuth 2.0

**Scalability Needs**
- Horizontal scaling to handle increased user demand
- CDN integration for fast image delivery globally
- Database optimization for large-scale character storage
- Queue management for batch processing requests
- Auto-scaling based on API usage patterns

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes**
- **User Adoption**: 1,000+ registered users within 3 months of launch
- **Generation Volume**: 10,000+ characters generated monthly
- **User Retention**: 40% monthly active user rate
- **Conversion Rate**: 15% of free users upgrade to paid plans
- **Platform Performance**: 95% of generations complete within 30 seconds

**Key Metrics and KPIs**
- Daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU)
- Average generations per user session
- Time spent on platform per session
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) vs lifetime value (LTV)
- API success rate and error frequency

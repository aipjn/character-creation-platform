# PRD: Character Creation Platform

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered web platform that enables video creators and advertising professionals to generate customizable characters using Google's nanoBanana model. The platform offers a two-step workflow: initial character generation from text descriptions or uploaded photos, followed by advanced styling with various poses, actions, and scene modifications. Features a freemium business model with 3 free daily generations and paid tiers for professional use.

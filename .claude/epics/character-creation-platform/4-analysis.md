# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #4

## Overview
Create React components for character generation workflow including text input, photo upload, batch generation, real-time status updates, and Redux Toolkit state management.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core UI Components
**Scope**: Base React components for text input, style selection, and form handling
**Files**:
- src/components/CharacterInput/TextInput.tsx
- src/components/CharacterInput/StyleSelector.tsx
- src/components/CharacterInput/GenerationForm.tsx
- src/components/CharacterInput/index.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: File Upload System
**Scope**: Photo upload functionality with drag-and-drop, validation, and preview
**Files**:
- src/components/FileUpload/DropZone.tsx
- src/components/FileUpload/FilePreview.tsx
- src/components/FileUpload/UploadValidator.ts
- src/components/FileUpload/index.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Batch Generation Interface
**Scope**: Batch processing UI, variation management, and results display
**Files**:
- src/components/BatchGeneration/BatchControls.tsx
- src/components/BatchGeneration/VariationGrid.tsx
- src/components/BatchGeneration/ResultsDisplay.tsx
- src/components/BatchGeneration/index.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Redux State Management
**Scope**: Redux Toolkit setup for generation queue, status tracking, and async operations
**Files**:
- src/store/slices/generationSlice.ts
- src/store/slices/queueSlice.ts
- src/store/middleware/websocketMiddleware.ts
- src/store/index.ts
- src/hooks/useGeneration.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream E: Integration & Real-time Updates
**Scope**: WebSocket integration, polling fallback, and component integration
**Files**:
- src/services/websocketService.ts
- src/services/generationService.ts
- src/components/StatusUpdates/ProgressIndicator.tsx
- src/components/StatusUpdates/QueueDisplay.tsx
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream D completes Redux setup
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Stream D

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
These files multiple streams need to coordinate on:
- `src/types/generation.ts` - All streams (coordinate type definitions)
- `src/styles/components.scss` - Streams A, B, C (coordinate styling)
- `package.json` - Stream D (add Redux dependencies)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical order dependencies:
1. Redux store structure before hooks and middleware
2. Base component types before integration
3. File upload types before batch processing
4. WebSocket service after Redux state management

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different component directories
- **Medium Risk**: Shared types file coordination needed
- **Low Risk**: Style coordination manageable with CSS modules or styled-components

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: parallel

Launch Streams A, B, C, D simultaneously. Start E when D completes Redux foundation.

The streams are well-isolated with clear boundaries:
- Each stream owns distinct component directories
- Type coordination can be handled through interfaces
- Redux setup provides foundation for real-time features
- Integration stream ties everything together

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 6 hours (max of streams A-D, then E)
- Total work: 24 hours (includes coordination overhead)
- Efficiency gain: 75%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 24 hours

## Notes
- Stream A should establish base component patterns for consistency
- Stream B file upload should include comprehensive validation
- Stream C should design for extensibility beyond 4 variations
- Stream D Redux setup should be flexible for future features
- Stream E integration should include error handling and fallbacks
- All components should be responsive and accessible
- Consider using React Hook Form for form state management
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props

# Authentication System with Auth0

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive authentication system using Auth0 to handle user registration, login, and session management for the character creation platform.

## Objectives
- Integrate Auth0 service for secure user authentication
- Set up user registration and login workflows
- Implement secure session management
- Create protected routes and middleware
- Establish user database models and relationships

## Tasks
1. **Auth0 Integration**
   - Set up Auth0 tenant and application
   - Configure Auth0 SDK for Node.js backend
   - Set up Auth0 client configuration
   - Configure callback URLs and domain settings

2. **User Registration and Login**
   - Implement user registration flow with Auth0
   - Create login/logout functionality
   - Set up social login providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Handle authentication errors and edge cases

3. **Session Management**
   - Configure secure session storage
   - Implement JWT token handling
   - Set up token refresh mechanisms
   - Create session timeout and cleanup

4. **Protected Routes**
   - Create authentication middleware
   - Implement route protection for sensitive endpoints
   - Set up role-based access control
   - Handle unauthorized access scenarios

5. **User Database Models**
   - Create user model in database
   - Set up user profile management
   - Implement user preferences storage
   - Create relationship models for user-character associations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auth0 is successfully integrated and configured
- [ ] Users can register and login using email/password
- [ ] Social login (Google, GitHub) works correctly
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly managed and validated
- [ ] Protected routes require authentication
- [ ] User sessions persist across browser sessions
- [ ] User profile data is stored and retrievable
- [ ] Logout functionality clears all session data

## Technical Requirements
- Auth0 SDK integration
- JWT token validation middleware
- Secure session storage (Redis recommended)
- User model with proper relationships
- Role-based access control system

## Estimated Hours: 12
## Size: M (Medium)
## Parallel: Yes - Can be worked on simultaneously with task 6
## Conflicts: Task 8 (Backend API Foundation) - requires coordination on user models

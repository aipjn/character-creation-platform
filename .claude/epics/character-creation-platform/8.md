# Backend API Foundation

## Overview
Create the foundational backend API structure with Express server, database connectivity, data models, and essential middleware for the character creation platform.

## Objectives
- Establish robust Express server architecture
- Implement comprehensive API routes and middleware
- Set up database connection with ORM integration
- Create core data models for users and characters
- Implement request validation and error handling systems

## Tasks
1. **Express Server Structure**
   - Create modular server architecture with proper separation of concerns
   - Set up environment configuration management
   - Implement server startup and graceful shutdown procedures
   - Configure CORS, security headers, and rate limiting

2. **API Routes and Middleware**
   - Create RESTful API route structure
   - Implement logging middleware for request tracking
   - Set up body parsing and file upload middleware
   - Create API versioning structure (v1, v2, etc.)

3. **Database Connection and ORM**
   - Set up database connection pooling
   - Configure ORM (Prisma or TypeORM) with TypeScript
   - Implement database health checks
   - Set up database migration and seeding systems

4. **Core Data Models**
   - Create User model with profile information
   - Create Character model with attributes and relationships
   - Implement CharacterTemplate model for reusable templates
   - Set up model relationships and foreign keys
   - Add model validation and constraints

5. **Request Validation and Error Handling**
   - Implement schema validation using Joi or Yup
   - Create centralized error handling middleware
   - Set up proper HTTP status codes and error responses
   - Implement request sanitization and security validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Express server runs with proper configuration
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible and properly structured
- [ ] Database connection is stable with connection pooling
- [ ] User and Character models are created and functional
- [ ] API requests are validated with appropriate error responses
- [ ] Error handling provides consistent and secure error messages
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] API documentation is generated (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Technical Requirements
- Express.js with TypeScript support
- Database ORM (Prisma or TypeORM)
- Request validation library (Joi/Yup)
- Comprehensive error handling system
- API documentation generation
- Database connection pooling
- Security middleware implementation

## Dependencies
- **Depends on Task 6**: Requires completed project setup and database infrastructure
- **Conflicts with Task 7**: Coordination needed on user model structure to avoid conflicts

## Estimated Hours: 14
## Size: M (Medium)
## Parallel: No - Must be completed sequentially after task 6

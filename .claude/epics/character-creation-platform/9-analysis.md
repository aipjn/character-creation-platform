# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #9

## Overview
Research and implement Google nanoBanana API client for AI-powered character generation with queuing, error handling, and status tracking. This task depends on Issue #8 (Backend API Foundation) completion.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: API Research and Client Setup
**Scope**: Research nanoBanana API, authentication, and basic client implementation
**Files**:
- docs/nanobanana-research.md
- src/services/nanoBananaClient.ts
- src/config/nanoBanana.ts
- src/types/nanoBanana.ts
- src/utils/authTokenManager.ts
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately (after Issue #8)
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: Issue #8 completion

### Stream B: Queue and Processing System
**Scope**: Request queuing, batch processing, and job management
**Files**:
- src/services/generationQueue.ts
- src/services/batchProcessor.ts
- src/models/GenerationJob.ts
- src/workers/queueWorker.ts
- src/utils/queueManager.ts
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes API client
**Estimated Hours**: 7
**Dependencies**: Stream A

### Stream C: Error Handling and Resilience
**Scope**: Retry logic, circuit breaker, rate limiting, and error recovery
**Files**:
- src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts
- src/utils/circuitBreaker.ts
- src/utils/retryHandler.ts
- src/services/errorRecovery.ts
- src/config/resilience.ts
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately (after Issue #8)
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: Issue #8 completion

### Stream D: Status Tracking and Monitoring
**Scope**: Progress tracking, webhooks, polling, and metrics collection
**Files**:
- src/services/statusTracker.ts
- src/controllers/webhookController.ts
- src/services/pollingService.ts
- src/utils/metricsCollector.ts
- src/middleware/generationMetrics.ts
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes basic integration
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: Stream A

### Stream E: Integration and Testing
**Scope**: Workflow integration, data format conversion, and comprehensive testing
**Files**:
- src/services/characterWorkflow.ts
- src/utils/dataConverter.ts
- tests/integration/nanoBanana.test.ts
- tests/performance/generationBenchmark.ts
- src/controllers/generationController.ts
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams B and D complete core functionality
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Stream B, Stream D

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
These files multiple streams need to coordinate on:
- `src/types/generation.ts` - All streams (coordinate generation types)
- `src/config/api.ts` - Streams A, C (coordinate API configuration)
- `package.json` - Streams A, B, C (add dependencies)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical order dependencies:
1. API client setup before queue implementation
2. Basic integration before status tracking
3. Core functionality before comprehensive testing
4. Error handling patterns established early

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Shared configuration and types need coordination
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on distinct functional areas
- **Low Risk**: Sequential dependencies are well-defined

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Phase 1: Launch Streams A, C simultaneously (research and resilience)
Phase 2: Start Streams B, D after A completes
Phase 3: Start Stream E after B and D complete

This approach balances parallelism with dependencies:
- Research and error handling can begin immediately
- Queue and monitoring wait for API client
- Integration waits for core systems to be ready

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Phase 1: 6 hours (A, C in parallel)
- Phase 2: 7 hours (B, D in parallel after A)
- Phase 3: 4 hours (E after B, D)
- Wall time: 10 hours (includes coordination overhead)
- Total work: 28 hours (includes coordination overhead)
- Efficiency gain: 64%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 28 hours

## Notes
- Stream A research should document API capabilities and limitations
- Stream B queue should support horizontal scaling for production
- Stream C resilience patterns should be reusable across the application
- Stream D monitoring should integrate with existing logging infrastructure
- Stream E integration should include comprehensive error scenarios
- Consider implementing API mocking for development and testing
- Plan for API quota monitoring and alerting
- Design for graceful degradation when nanoBanana API is unavailable
- Include performance benchmarking for generation time requirements

# File Management and Storage

**Size**: M  
**Hours**: 12  
**Parallel**: true

## Overview

Implement comprehensive file management system with S3 storage, CDN delivery, and image optimization for character assets and generated content.

## Requirements

### S3 Storage Integration
- Set up AWS S3 buckets with proper security policies
- Implement secure file upload/download functionality
- Create organized folder structure for character assets
- Add file metadata and tagging system
- Implement multipart upload for large files

### Secure URL Generation
- Create presigned URL system for temporary access
- Implement access control and permission checking
- Add URL expiration and rotation mechanisms
- Create secure direct upload capabilities for client applications

### CloudFront CDN
- Configure CloudFront distribution for global content delivery
- Set up cache invalidation and purging mechanisms
- Optimize cache policies for different file types
- Implement custom domain and SSL certificate management

### Image Optimization
- Add automatic image resizing and format conversion
- Implement WebP and AVIF format support for modern browsers
- Create thumbnail generation for character previews
- Add image compression without quality loss

### Bulk Operations
- Implement bulk download capabilities for user portfolios
- Create ZIP file generation for character collections
- Add batch upload processing for multiple files
- Implement progress tracking for long-running operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] S3 integration handles file uploads/downloads securely
- [ ] Presigned URLs provide time-limited access to files
- [ ] CloudFront CDN delivers content globally with low latency
- [ ] Image optimization reduces file sizes without quality loss
- [ ] Bulk download creates ZIP files for character collections
- [ ] File metadata and tagging system enables search and organization
- [ ] Upload progress tracking works for large file operations
- [ ] Access control prevents unauthorized file access
- [ ] Cache invalidation updates CDN content when files change

## Technical Notes

- Consider S3 storage classes for cost optimization
- Implement proper IAM roles and policies for security
- Plan for disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Design for high availability and fault tolerance
- Consider GDPR compliance for user data deletion
- Optimize for mobile upload scenarios with retry logic

# Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Overview
Set up the foundational infrastructure and development environment for the character creation platform.

## Objectives
- Establish Node.js backend with Express framework
- Configure TypeScript for type safety across frontend and backend
- Set up PostgreSQL database with basic schema structure
- Configure AWS S3 bucket for image storage capabilities
- Implement basic CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Tasks
1. **Node.js Backend Setup**
   - Initialize Node.js project with Express framework
   - Configure package.json with necessary dependencies
   - Set up basic server structure and entry points

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Install and configure TypeScript for both frontend and backend
   - Set up tsconfig.json files with appropriate compiler options
   - Configure build scripts and development workflows

3. **Database Setup**
   - Install and configure PostgreSQL
   - Create initial database schema for users and characters
   - Set up database connection configuration
   - Create migration scripts for schema versioning

4. **AWS S3 Configuration**
   - Set up AWS S3 bucket for image storage
   - Configure bucket policies and permissions
   - Set up AWS SDK integration
   - Create image upload/download utilities

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD service
   - Configure automated testing pipeline
   - Set up deployment scripts
   - Configure environment-specific configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js backend runs successfully with Express
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors for both frontend and backend
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is accessible and schema is applied
- [ ] AWS S3 bucket is configured and accessible
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and deploys the application
- [ ] Development environment is fully functional

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js v18+ with Express framework
- TypeScript 5.0+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- AWS S3 with proper IAM roles
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

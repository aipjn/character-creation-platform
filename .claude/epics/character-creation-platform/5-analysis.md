# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #5

## Overview
Build user character gallery with comprehensive management features including search, filtering, tagging, sharing capabilities, and responsive design for desktop and tablet.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Gallery Display Components
**Scope**: Core gallery layouts, character cards, and view switching functionality
**Files**:
- src/components/Gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/GalleryList.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/CharacterCard.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/ViewToggle.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/index.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Search and Filter System
**Scope**: Search functionality, filter components, and advanced filtering logic
**Files**:
- src/components/Search/SearchBar.tsx
- src/components/Search/FilterPanel.tsx
- src/components/Search/FilterChips.tsx
- src/hooks/useSearch.ts
- src/hooks/useFilters.ts
- src/utils/searchUtils.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Tag Management System
**Scope**: Tag creation, editing, deletion, and character categorization
**Files**:
- src/components/Tags/TagEditor.tsx
- src/components/Tags/TagInput.tsx
- src/components/Tags/CategoryManager.tsx
- src/components/Tags/TagCloud.tsx
- src/hooks/useTags.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Actions and Sharing
**Scope**: Download functionality, sharing features, and bulk operations
**Files**:
- src/components/Actions/DownloadButton.tsx
- src/components/Actions/ShareButton.tsx
- src/components/Actions/BulkActions.tsx
- src/services/downloadService.ts
- src/services/shareService.ts
- src/utils/exportUtils.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream E: Dashboard and Analytics
**Scope**: Usage tracking dashboard, pagination, and account information display
**Files**:
- src/components/Dashboard/UsageDashboard.tsx
- src/components/Dashboard/AccountInfo.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/Pagination.tsx
- src/components/Gallery/InfiniteScroll.tsx
- src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes gallery structure
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: Stream A

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
These files multiple streams need to coordinate on:
- `src/types/character.ts` - All streams (coordinate character data types)
- `src/types/gallery.ts` - Streams A, B, E (coordinate gallery state types)
- `src/styles/gallery.scss` - Streams A, D (coordinate styling)
- `src/contexts/GalleryContext.tsx` - Streams A, B, C (coordinate state management)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical order dependencies:
1. Gallery structure before dashboard integration
2. Character types before search/filter implementation
3. Base gallery components before bulk operations
4. Context setup before advanced features

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Shared context and types need coordination
- **Low Risk**: Component directories are well-separated
- **Low Risk**: Styling conflicts manageable with CSS modules

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: parallel

Launch Streams A, B, C, D simultaneously. Start E when A completes basic gallery structure.

The streams have clear functional boundaries:
- Each stream handles distinct user features
- Gallery context can be designed upfront for all streams
- Type definitions can be established early
- Integration happens at the context/service level

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 5 hours (max of streams A-D, then E)
- Total work: 18 hours (includes coordination overhead)
- Efficiency gain: 72%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 18 hours

## Notes
- Stream A should establish gallery context and character types early
- Stream B search should be optimized for large character collections
- Stream C tag system should support hierarchical categories
- Stream D sharing should include social media metadata
- Stream E dashboard should include usage quotas and subscription info
- All components should follow accessibility guidelines
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large galleries
- Include comprehensive keyboard navigation support
- Design for both desktop and tablet breakpoints

# Stream E: Validation and Error Handling

## Scope
Request validation, error middleware, and security validation

## Files
- src/middleware/validation.ts
- src/middleware/errorHandler.ts
- src/schemas/userSchema.ts
- src/schemas/characterSchema.ts
- src/utils/sanitization.ts

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive validation schemas for User and Character models
  - UserSchema with email, name, auth0Id, avatar, and subscription tier validation
  - CharacterSchema with prompt, name, tags, style type, URLs, and metadata validation
  - Input sanitization and validation result interfaces
  - Support for both create and update operations

- ✅ Implemented request validation middleware
  - Generic validation middleware factory with sanitization support
  - Specific middlewares for user and character operations
  - Query parameter and path parameter validation
  - File upload validation with size and type restrictions
  - Content-Type validation middleware
  - Comprehensive error handling integration

- ✅ Created centralized error handling middleware
  - Custom AppError base class with status codes and error details
  - Specific error classes (NotFoundError, ValidationError, DatabaseError, etc.)
  - Prisma error handling with proper HTTP status mapping
  - Request tracking with unique request IDs
  - Configurable logging and stack trace inclusion
  - Production-safe error message sanitization

- ✅ Built security-focused sanitization utilities
  - HTML entity escaping and XSS prevention
  - SQL injection detection and sanitization
  - Path traversal attack prevention
  - Control character and null byte removal
  - Unicode normalization for homograph attack prevention
  - Comprehensive filename, URL, and email sanitization
  - JSON object recursive sanitization with depth limits

- ✅ Added comprehensive test suites
  - Complete test coverage for UserSchema validation
  - Complete test coverage for CharacterSchema validation
  - Extensive SanitizationUtils testing with edge cases
  - Error handler middleware testing with various error types
  - Validation middleware testing with mock Express objects
  - Tests cover both success and failure scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created:
1. **src/schemas/userSchema.ts** - User validation with email, name, auth0Id validation
2. **src/schemas/characterSchema.ts** - Character validation with prompt, tags, metadata validation
3. **src/middleware/validation.ts** - Request validation middleware with sanitization
4. **src/middleware/errorHandler.ts** - Centralized error handling with proper HTTP responses
5. **src/utils/sanitization.ts** - Security-focused input sanitization utilities

### Key Features Implemented:
- Type-safe validation with TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive input sanitization against XSS, SQL injection, and path traversal
- Flexible validation middleware supporting both body, query, and path parameters
- Error handling with request tracking and configurable logging
- Production-ready security measures with safe error responses
- Extensive test coverage ensuring reliability

### Security Measures:
- HTML entity escaping and dangerous tag removal
- SQL injection pattern detection and prevention
- Path traversal attempt sanitization
- File upload validation with type and size restrictions
- Unicode normalization to prevent homograph attacks
- Request header sanitization with whitelisting approach

### Coordination Notes:
- Validation schemas coordinate with existing Prisma model structure
- Error handling integrates with existing logging patterns
- Sanitization utilities complement existing validation in src/utils/validation.ts
- All validation follows consistent patterns for maintainability

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All assigned work for Stream E (Validation and Error Handling) has been successfully completed. The implementation provides robust request validation, comprehensive error handling, and security-focused input sanitization that integrates well with the existing codebase architecture.

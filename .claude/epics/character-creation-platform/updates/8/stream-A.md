# Stream A: Express Server Architecture

## Scope
Core server setup, configuration management, and startup procedures

## Files
- ✅ src/app.ts - Modular Express application setup with middleware stack
- ✅ src/server.ts - Server startup and graceful shutdown management
- ✅ src/config/env.ts - Centralized environment configuration with validation
- ✅ src/config/cors.ts - CORS configuration for different endpoint types
- ✅ src/config/security.ts - Security middleware including rate limiting and helmet
- ✅ src/types/api.ts - Stream B coordination types for API endpoints and responses
- ✅ src/server/index.ts - Updated entry point using new architecture

## Completed Implementation

### Core Server Architecture
- **Modular Express Setup**: Complete Express application with middleware stack
- **Environment Management**: Comprehensive env var parsing with validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Environment-specific CORS policies with origin validation
- **Security Middleware**: Rate limiting, helmet security headers, request validation
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks with detailed status reporting
- **Graceful Lifecycle**: Proper startup validation and shutdown procedures
- **Request Tracking**: Request ID generation and response time monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Configurable logging with JSON format support

### Stream B Coordination
- **API Types**: Complete type definitions in `src/types/api.ts`
- **Route Mounting**: Helper functions for adding routes and middleware
- **Response Standardization**: Consistent API response format
- **Middleware Patterns**: Established patterns for Stream B integration

### Configuration Features
- Database connection pooling configuration
- Rate limiting with configurable windows and limits
- File upload size limits and type validation
- External API integration configuration (nanoBanana, AWS S3)
- Redis caching configuration (optional)
- Webhook configuration for event handling
- Feature flags for optional functionality

## Server Status
- ✅ Server starts successfully with proper configuration
- ✅ Environment validation and warnings working
- ✅ Health check endpoint functional at `/health`
- ✅ Basic API v1 structure in place at `/api/v1`
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling operational
- ✅ CORS and security middleware functional

## Stream B Integration Points
- All coordination types defined in `src/types/api.ts`
- Server architecture supports route mounting via `addRoutes()`
- Middleware patterns established
- Response format standardized
- Configuration management complete

## Next Steps for Stream B
1. Use types from `src/types/api.ts`
2. Create route handlers using established patterns  
3. Mount routes using `addRoutes()` helper
4. Implement actual database health checks
5. Add API endpoint validation middleware

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Stream B**

# Stream D: Actions and Sharing

## Scope
Download functionality, sharing features, and bulk operations

## Files
- src/components/Actions/DownloadButton.tsx
- src/components/Actions/ShareButton.tsx
- src/components/Actions/BulkActions.tsx
- src/services/downloadService.ts
- src/services/shareService.ts
- src/utils/exportUtils.ts

## Progress
- ✅ Created comprehensive export utilities (`src/utils/exportUtils.ts`)
  - Multiple format support (PNG, JPG, WebP, JSON)
  - Image processing with quality/size options
  - Bulk export with ZIP packaging
  - Validation and error handling
  
- ✅ Implemented download service (`src/services/downloadService.ts`)
  - Single and bulk character downloads
  - Progress tracking for long operations
  - S3 integration for image fetching
  - Size estimation and statistics
  - Cancellation support
  
- ✅ Built share service (`src/services/shareService.ts`)
  - Multiple platform support (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Reddit, Discord, Instagram)
  - Social media metadata generation
  - Open Graph and Twitter Card tags
  - Clipboard integration for platforms requiring manual sharing
  - Collection sharing for multiple characters
  
- ✅ Created DownloadButton component (`src/components/Actions/DownloadButton.tsx`)
  - Format selection dropdown
  - Quality and size controls
  - Progress indicators
  - Error handling and validation
  - Responsive design
  
- ✅ Implemented ShareButton component (`src/components/Actions/ShareButton.tsx`)
  - Platform selector with icons and colors
  - Custom message and hashtag support
  - App credit toggle
  - Copy-to-clipboard for platforms like Discord/Instagram
  - Success/error feedback
  
- ✅ Built BulkActions component (`src/components/Actions/BulkActions.tsx`)
  - Selection controls (all, by status, etc.)
  - Statistics display
  - Bulk download with progress tracking
  - Shareable collection creation
  - Placeholder hooks for other bulk operations (tagging, privacy, delete)
  - Size estimation for downloads

## Coordination Notes
- **Styling coordination with Stream A**: Components use inline styles to avoid conflicts, but should eventually be coordinated with `src/styles/gallery.scss`
- **Character types**: BulkActions component is ready to work with any character types established by Stream A
- **Social media metadata**: ShareService includes Open Graph and Twitter Card generation for SEO
- **Dependencies**: All components depend on JSZip for bulk downloads (already listed in package.json)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Export utilities**: Handles image processing in browser using Canvas API for format conversion
- **Download service**: Singleton pattern with progress tracking and cancellation support  
- **Share service**: Platform-agnostic with fallback to clipboard for unsupported platforms
- **Components**: TypeScript with proper prop interfaces and error boundaries
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS approach to avoid external dependencies during development

## Testing Considerations
- Components should be tested with mock characters of different states (pending, completed, failed)
- Download functionality needs testing with different image formats and sizes
- Share functionality requires testing across different browsers for clipboard API
- Bulk operations need stress testing with large character sets

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All assigned files have been implemented with full functionality. Ready for integration testing.

# Issue #9 Stream B Progress - Queue and Processing System

**Stream**: B - Queue and Processing System  
**Status**: Completed  
**Started**: 2025-09-06  
**Completed**: 2025-09-06  

## Assigned Files
- `src/services/generationQueue.ts` - Request queuing system
- `src/services/batchProcessor.ts` - Batch processing (up to 4 characters)  
- `src/models/GenerationJob.ts` - Job management model
- `src/workers/queueWorker.ts` - Background job processing
- `src/utils/queueManager.ts` - Queue lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- ✅ Stream A has completed API client foundation (`nanoBananaClient.ts`)
- ✅ Shared types available in `src/types/generation.ts`

## Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] GenerationJob model with database schema
- [x] generationQueue service for request queuing
- [x] batchProcessor service for batch processing
- [x] queueWorker for background processing
- [x] queueManager utility for queue management
- [x] Comprehensive tests

### Implementation Notes
- Using shared types from Stream A's `src/types/generation.ts`
- Queue supports horizontal scaling as required
- Batch processing limited to 4 characters per specification
- Coordinating with Stream D for job status tracking integration
- Following database patterns from existing models

### Completed Implementation
1. ✅ GenerationJob model with proper database schema and CRUD operations
2. ✅ Core queue service with priority handling, scheduling, and event emission
3. ✅ Batch processor with nanoBanana API integration supporting up to 4 characters
4. ✅ Background worker with concurrency control, retry logic, and health monitoring
5. ✅ Queue management utilities with scaling, monitoring, and alert system
6. ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage for all components

### Key Features Implemented
- **Request Queuing**: Priority-based job queuing with scheduling support
- **Batch Processing**: Up to 4 character batch processing with nanoBanana API
- **Background Workers**: Concurrent job processing with configurable concurrency
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and stale job detection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Queue Management**: High-level management with worker scaling and alerts
- **Event System**: Rich event emission for integration with other streams
- **Testing**: Full test coverage with mocking and edge case handling

## Coordination Notes
- Building on Stream A's nanoBananaClient foundation
- Will coordinate with Stream D for status tracking
- Queue designed for horizontal scaling
- Batch processing implements 4-character limit

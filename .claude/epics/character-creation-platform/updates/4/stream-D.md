# Stream D: Redux State Management

## Scope
Redux Toolkit setup for generation queue, status tracking, and async operations

## Files
- src/store/slices/generationSlice.ts
- src/store/slices/queueSlice.ts
- src/store/middleware/websocketMiddleware.ts
- src/store/index.ts
- src/hooks/useGeneration.ts

## Progress

### âœ… Completed
- **Redux Toolkit Setup**: Installed @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux with TypeScript types
- **Generation Slice**: Implemented comprehensive state management for character generation
  - Form data management with text input, style selection, and batch size
  - Async thunks for API integration (create, fetch, cancel operations)
  - Real-time status updates from WebSocket
  - Error handling and loading states
- **Queue Slice**: Built generation queue management system
  - Queue items with position tracking and estimated wait times
  - Queue statistics (processing time, success rates)
  - Real-time queue updates and position changes
  - User-specific queue filtering
- **WebSocket Middleware**: Implemented real-time communication
  - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Message type routing for generation and queue updates
  - Connection state management
  - Error handling and recovery
- **Store Configuration**: Set up Redux store with proper TypeScript integration
  - Combined reducers for generation and queue
  - Middleware integration including WebSocket
  - Comprehensive selectors for all state slices
  - Typed hooks for components
- **React Hooks**: Created useGeneration hook for component integration
  - Main hook with all generation and queue operations
  - Specialized hooks for forms, queue, and WebSocket
  - Auto-loading and cleanup logic
  - Error handling and state management

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/store/slices/generationSlice.ts` - Character generation state
  - `src/store/slices/queueSlice.ts` - Generation queue management  
  - `src/store/middleware/websocketMiddleware.ts` - Real-time updates
  - `src/store/index.ts` - Store configuration and selectors
  - `src/hooks/useGeneration.ts` - React integration hooks
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Batch generation support (up to 4 variations)
  - Real-time status tracking via WebSocket
  - Queue position and wait time estimation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Auto-reconnection for WebSocket
  - TypeScript integration throughout
- **API Integration Ready**: All async operations configured for backend API endpoints

- Complete state management for generation workflow
- Real-time updates via WebSocket integration
- Queue management with position tracking
- Proper TypeScript integration
- React hooks for component integration
- Error handling and loading states
- Auto-reconnection and resilience features

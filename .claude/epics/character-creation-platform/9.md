# nanoBanana API Integration

**Size**: L  
**Hours**: 20  
**Parallel**: false  
**Depends on**: [8]

## Overview

Research and implement Google nanoBanana API client to enable AI-powered character generation with proper queuing, error handling, and status tracking.

## Requirements

### Core Implementation
- Research Google nanoBanana API capabilities and integration requirements
- Create robust API client with proper authentication handling
- Implement request queuing system for batch processing (up to 4 characters)
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement API rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns

### Status and Monitoring
- Create generation status tracking system
- Add progress monitoring for long-running generation tasks
- Implement webhook or polling mechanism for completion notifications
- Create logging and metrics collection for API usage

### Integration Points
- Integrate with character creation workflow from task 8
- Ensure proper data flow from character specifications to API requests
- Handle API responses and convert to internal character data format

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] nanoBanana API client successfully integrated
- [ ] Batch processing queue handles up to 4 character requests
- [ ] Error handling covers all API failure scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API quota violations
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Status tracking provides real-time generation progress
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end character generation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet generation time requirements

## Technical Notes

- Consider API quotas and rate limits in design
- Implement proper authentication token management
- Design for horizontal scaling of queue processing
- Plan for API version updates and deprecations

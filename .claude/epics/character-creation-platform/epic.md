# Epic: Character Creation Platform

## Overview

Build a web-based AI character generation platform that leverages Google's nanoBanana API to create customizable characters for video creators and advertisers. The platform implements a streamlined two-step workflow: base character generation from text/photo inputs, followed by advanced styling modifications. Architecture prioritizes simplicity with a React frontend, Node.js backend, and cloud-based image storage.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and component reusability
- **Backend Runtime**: Node.js with Express for rapid development and nanoBanana API integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user accounts, generation history, and metadata
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN for fast global delivery
- **Authentication**: Auth0 for OAuth 2.0 compliance and security
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for subscription management and freemium model
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, AWS Lambda/Railway for backend services

**Key Design Patterns**:
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer for business logic separation
- Queue pattern for batch processing nanoBanana requests
- Observer pattern for real-time generation status updates

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Character Generator**: Main interface with text/photo input, style selection, and batch generation
- **Character Editor**: Styling interface with pose, action, and scene modification tools
- **Gallery Manager**: User's character library with search, tagging, and download functionality
- **Account Dashboard**: Usage tracking, subscription management, and generation history
- **Authentication Flow**: Login/register components with OAuth integration

**State Management**: Redux Toolkit for global state (user session, generation queue, character gallery)

### Backend Services
- **Authentication API**: User registration, login, and session management via Auth0
- **Generation API**: nanoBanana integration with request queuing and status tracking
- **Character API**: CRUD operations for character metadata, tags, and user associations
- **Payment API**: Stripe integration for subscription lifecycle and usage tracking
- **File Management API**: S3 upload/download with secure URL generation

**Data Models**:
```
Users: id, email, auth0_id, subscription_tier, daily_quota, created_at
Characters: id, user_id, prompt, style_type, s3_url, metadata, created_at
Generations: id, user_id, status, batch_size, nanoBanana_request_id, created_at
```

### Infrastructure
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting and request validation before nanoBanana calls
- **Background Jobs**: Queue processing for generation requests using Bull/BullMQ
- **Monitoring**: Application metrics with DataDog/New Relic for performance tracking
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and frequently accessed character metadata

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Platform (MVP)**
- Basic character generation with text input
- User authentication and account management
- Simple gallery for generated characters
- Freemium quota system (3 daily free generations)

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Photo-to-character generation
- Character styling and modification tools
- Enhanced gallery with search and tagging
- Subscription payments via Stripe

**Phase 3: Optimization**
- Batch processing improvements
- Performance optimization
- Advanced UI/UX enhancements
- Analytics and user feedback systems

**Risk Mitigation**:
- nanoBanana API dependency: Implement circuit breaker pattern and fallback messaging
- Rate limiting: Build queue system to handle API constraints gracefully
- Performance: Implement progressive loading and image optimization from day one

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Authentication & User Management**: Auth0 integration, user registration, session management
- [ ] **nanoBanana API Integration**: API client, request queuing, error handling, batch processing
- [ ] **Character Generation UI**: React components for text/photo input, style selection, generation workflow
- [ ] **Character Gallery & Management**: User gallery, search/filter, metadata management, download functionality
- [ ] **Payment & Subscription System**: Stripe integration, freemium logic, usage tracking, billing
- [ ] **Backend Infrastructure**: Database setup, API endpoints, file storage, deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Character Styling System**: Advanced editing interface, real-time preview, pose/scene modifications
- [ ] **Performance & Monitoring**: Caching, CDN setup, analytics, error tracking, load testing

## Dependencies

**External Service Dependencies**:
- Google nanoBanana API availability and quota allocation
- Auth0 service for authentication infrastructure
- Stripe for payment processing and subscription management
- AWS services (S3, CloudFront, Lambda) for storage and CDN

**Internal Team Dependencies**:
- Frontend developer for React application development
- Backend developer for Node.js API and nanoBanana integration
- UI/UX designer for creative workflow optimization
- DevOps engineer for infrastructure setup and deployment

**Prerequisite Work**:
- Google nanoBanana API access and documentation review
- Auth0 tenant configuration and domain setup
- AWS account setup and S3 bucket configuration
- Stripe account setup and webhook configuration

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Character generation: <30 seconds end-to-end (including nanoBanana API response)
- Page load times: <2 seconds for all main application pages
- Image delivery: <1 second via CDN for cached images
- API response times: <500ms for non-generation endpoints

**Quality Gates**:
- 95% uptime SLA for platform availability
- Zero data loss for user accounts and generated characters
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- 100% test coverage for critical payment and generation flows

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Successful integration with nanoBanana API for both text and photo inputs
- Freemium model with accurate usage tracking and quota enforcement
- Complete character generation workflow from input to download
- Responsive design working across desktop and tablet devices

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 8-10 weeks for MVP, 16-20 weeks for full feature set

**Resource Requirements**:
- 1 Full-stack developer (primary)
- 1 Frontend specialist (React/TypeScript)
- 1 Backend specialist (Node.js/API integration)
- 0.5 DevOps engineer (infrastructure setup)
- 0.5 UI/UX designer (workflow optimization)

**Critical Path Items**:
1. nanoBanana API integration and testing (Week 1-2)
2. User authentication and account system (Week 2-3)
3. Core character generation workflow (Week 3-5)
4. Payment integration and freemium logic (Week 6-7)
5. Production deployment and monitoring setup (Week 8)

**Risk Buffer**: 20% additional time allocated for nanoBanana API integration challenges and performance optimization.

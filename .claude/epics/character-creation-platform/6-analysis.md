# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #6

## Overview
Set up foundational infrastructure for character creation platform including Node.js backend, TypeScript configuration, PostgreSQL database, AWS S3 storage, and CI/CD pipeline.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Backend Foundation
**Scope**: Node.js backend setup with Express framework and core structure
**Files**:
- package.json
- server.js or index.ts
- src/server/
- src/routes/
- src/middleware/
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: TypeScript Configuration
**Scope**: TypeScript setup for both frontend and backend with build configuration
**Files**:
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.server.json
- tsconfig.client.json
- webpack.config.js or vite.config.ts
- build scripts in package.json
**Agent Type**: fullstack-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Database Layer
**Scope**: PostgreSQL setup, schema design, and database connection configuration
**Files**:
- src/database/
- migrations/
- src/models/
- src/config/database.ts
- docker-compose.yml (if using Docker)
**Agent Type**: database-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: AWS S3 Integration
**Scope**: S3 bucket configuration, SDK integration, and image utilities
**Files**:
- src/services/s3.ts
- src/utils/image.ts
- src/config/aws.ts
- .env.example (AWS variables)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream E: CI/CD Pipeline
**Scope**: GitHub Actions setup, automated testing, and deployment configuration
**Files**:
- .github/workflows/
- .env.example
- Dockerfile (if needed)
- deployment scripts
**Agent Type**: fullstack-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete basic structure
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Stream A, Stream B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
These files multiple streams need to modify:
- `package.json` - Streams A, B, C, D (coordinate dependency additions)
- `.env.example` - Streams C, D (add respective environment variables)
- `src/types/` - Streams A, C, D (coordinate type definitions)

### Sequential Requirements
Critical order dependencies:
1. Basic package.json structure before specific dependencies
2. TypeScript config before build scripts
3. Basic server structure before CI/CD pipeline
4. Environment variables defined before deployment scripts

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Most streams work on different directories and file patterns
- **Medium Risk**: package.json coordination needed, manageable with proper ordering
- **Low Risk**: Environment variables can be easily merged

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: parallel

Launch Streams A, B, C, D simultaneously. Start E when A & B have basic structure complete.

The streams are well-isolated with minimal overlap. Coordination mainly needed for:
- package.json dependency additions (can be merged easily)
- Environment variable definitions (non-conflicting)
- Type definitions (can be organized by domain)

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 5 hours (max of streams A-D, then E)
- Total work: 19 hours (includes coordination overhead)
- Efficiency gain: 73%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 19 hours

## Notes
- Stream A should establish basic project structure first to guide other streams
- Stream B TypeScript config should be flexible enough to accommodate backend and future frontend
- Stream C database schema should be minimal but extensible for character data
- Stream D AWS integration should include proper error handling and fallback options
- Stream E CI/CD should include environment-specific configurations
- All streams should include basic error handling and logging
- Consider using environment variables for all external service configurations
